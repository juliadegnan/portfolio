## My documentation process
As an experienced Staff and CW Technical Writer, I managed comprehensive documentation sets for various projects on many platforms such as AWS, SAP, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. My documentation process is as follows:
1. Review engineering pull requests and test the functionality to be documented as the initial user of the product.
2. Document all steps taken, code executed, and issues encountered.
3. Schedule a meeting with the lead engineer to review my notes and seek clarification or corrections regarding my understanding.
4. Write the first draft over the next several days, followed by editing for grammar, tone, and style.
5. Request a review by creating a pull request or using other established request procedures.
6. Publish the deliverable.
