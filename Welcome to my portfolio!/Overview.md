## My documentation process

As a seasoned Staff and CW Technical Writer, I owned entire documentation sets for various projects hosted on platforms such as, AWS, SAP, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

My documentation process is as follows:

 1. Examine engineering PRs and test the functionality to be documented as the first user of the product.
 2. Document all steps taken, code run, and issues encountered.
 3. Set up time with lead engineer to go through my notes and ask for clarification and corrections in my understanding.
 4. Over the next few days, write the first draft, then edit the draft for grammar, tone, and style.
 5. Request a review by creating a Pull Request or by other request procedures established.
 6. Publish the deliverable.
